# Company Home Page 

This project is a Codecademy project. I was given a task to make a home page for a Real or Fake company. They also provided some ideas for what needs to be added to make a good company home page. Within this project, I used HTML/CSS/JS. The company I decided to use was a fake salon company.  


## Here is the Ideas / Instructions I was given.
